# Hi

This is a webpage that I wrote without code

```rust
fn main() {
  let number1 = 10;
  let number2 = 20;
  println!("{}", number1 + number2);
}
```

An alternative way to author content is using `.mdx` files ([Tracker Site tot Test](https://tracker.reng.ar)). These files are authored as Markdown, but they are compiled down to Qwik components. In addition to Markdown syntax, `.mdx` files can also refer to other components.
